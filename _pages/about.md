Yang is currently a Ph.D student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at University of California San Diego (UCSD), advised by [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/). He has received [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2023-north-america) (2023). Before that, he obtained his M.S. in ECE at UIUC in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas S. Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rGF6-WkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (1936-2020) and [Prof. Humphrey Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/).
