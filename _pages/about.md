Yang is currently a Ph.D student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at University of California San Diego (UCSD), advised by [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/). Before that, he obtained his M.S. in ECE at UIUC in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas S. Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rGF6-WkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (1936-2020) and [Prof. Humphrey Shi]((https://www.humphreyshi.com/). Before coming to UIUC, he received his B.S. in ECE from Beihang University in 2017.
## Research Interests

My current research focuses on **computer vision** and **machine learning**. Specifically, I have recently worked in 
* _**Computer Vision**_
  * video instance/object segmentation, pose tracking, visual correspondence learning, person re-identification

* _**Machine Learning**_
  * domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised representation learning, test-time training.

Please refer to my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bioUtz4AAAAJ&hl=en) for a full list of my publications.
