Yang is currently a Ph.D student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at University of California San Diego (UCSD), advised by [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/). Before that, he obtained his M.S. in ECE at UIUC in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas S. Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rGF6-WkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (1936-2020) and [Prof. Humphrey Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/). Before coming to UIUC, he received his B.S. in ECE from Beihang University.

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on **computer vision** and **machine learning**. Specifically, I have recently worked in 
* _**Computer Vision**_
  * 6D pose estimation, video instance/object segmentation, pose tracking, visual correspondence learning.

* _**Machine Learning**_
  * semi-supervised learning, self-supervised representation learning, test-time training.

Please refer to my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bioUtz4AAAAJ&hl=en) for a full list of my publications.
## News
* \[2022.06\] Check out our [Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation in the Wild: A Semi-Supervised Learning Approach and A New Dataset](https://oasisyang.github.io/semi-pose/) which introduces an in-the-wild object-centric RGBD dataset with 5000+ videos over 1700+ objects. We peform semi-supervised 6D object pose estimation on it without human annotations. 

* \[2022.06\] I start my summer internship at Nvidia Research.
