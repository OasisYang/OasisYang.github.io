Yang is currently a Ph.D student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at University of California San Diego (UCSD), advised by [Prof. Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/). I've received [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2023-north-america) (2023).

Before that, he obtained his M.S. in ECE at UIUC in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas S. Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rGF6-WkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (1936-2020) and [Prof. Humphrey Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/).

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on **computer vision** and **machine learning**. Specifically, I have recently worked in

- _**Computer Vision**_

  - Neural Radiance Fields, 6D pose estimation, video instance/object segmentation.

- _**Machine Learning**_
  - semi-supervised learning, self-supervised representation learning, test-time training.

Please refer to my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bioUtz4AAAAJ&hl=en) for a full list of my publications.
